##The Postcard

This exercise encompasses the tags learned so far about HTML
for its structure, some of them are: the basic structure of HTML,
control in `<div>`, `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<input>`, etc. tags.

For the creation of the Postcard, a parent container was used, which has
as children plus bins split into each of the containing boxes
information, on the other hand, was also applied using text input
to write the sender's data and thus be able to send the message using
a button that ends the process.
